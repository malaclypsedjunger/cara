a memory allocator for metrics.

the memory is backed by a memory mapped file (so that external agents can
cheaply poll the metrics w/o disturbing the application).

no locks are used in reading - so it is up to the reader to check for
"consistency" (or not)

the file consists of two parts: a symbol table and the actual data.

the data types supported:
	- 32 bit integer
	- 64 bit integer
	- floats (4 bytes?)
	- double (8 bytes?)
	- long double (16 bytes?)
	- strings?
	- histograms?
